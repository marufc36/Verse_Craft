# Verse_Craft

## Overview 
This project is a learning endeavor in the realm of generative AI, employing natural language processing (NLP) for text generation. The integration of the Hugging Face API into a Flask web application allows for the deployment of the application on Render. Detailed insights into the training process can be found within the repository's model branch. Through this project, I aim to delve deeper into the intricacies of NLP-based text generation while honing my skills in the field of generative AI.


## Flask Application
Initially, the model was deployed on Hugging Face Spaces. Subsequently, I integrated the Hugging Face Spaces API into the Flask web application. The application consists of two HTML pages: index.html and result.html. In the index.html page, users input a poetic line, based on which the model generates an output, which is then displayed on the result.html page. This setup enables users to interact with the model and receive generated poetic verses based on their input.
